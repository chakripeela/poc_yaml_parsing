  Perform independent security validation:
      Objective:
          - "Validate a product or application's resiliency"
      Applicable If:
          - "Product or application introduces new security controls or features."
          - "Product or application introduces new interfaces."
      Requirements:
          - "Engineering and Development teams should consider and apply independent penetration testing to products."
      Guidance: >
          This type of testing should be performed by company internal resources50 that are independent in reporting structure to the product development organization or by 3rd party vendors that specialize in penetration testing.
          Because independent penetration testing generally has a cost associated with it, it is recommended that it is only deployed after the  Engineering and Development team has adopted all other analysis activities and has made significant inroads with SDL control implementation and validation. Otherwise the independent validation is likely to raise issues that are easily discovered using basic techniques. It is also recommended that the Security Champions be involved in the pen test process and ensure that the effort reflects input from any threat modeling or security testing that has been performed. In this context penetration testing can help drive continuous improvement of security engineering practices.
          In addition to continuous improvement purposes, it is recommended that a Penetration test be conducted anytime when one or more of the below situation occurs
            Product or functionality targets security or a highly regulated market.
            Likelihood of being attacked (e.g. high profile or high value target.
            Large number of externally reported vulnerabilities on product.
            Major release that adds significant new functionality or attack surface.
          In some scenarios, crowd-sourced security validation (e.g. a Bug Bounty) may be used to achieve this control objective. Contact Product Security Office at the Service Desk51 for more information.
          In general, minor releases without new security functionality do not require pen testing.
          An independent validation is one that is conducted by a technical expert who does not report to the same management chain as the product development organization.
          For more information on independent validation and to submit a request, please visit Independent Security Testing52.
